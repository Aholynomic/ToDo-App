# ToDo App
Android App to Schedule Events

## Purpose
The app is responsible for allowing users to create events and remain on task by keeping organised. It was created during the module CMP309, a time where we had to keep ourselves motivated during a stressful time in third year, what with keeping up with heavy coursework demands of other modules and remote working. Users can navigate the app using the bottom navigation functionality. Navigating to the Schedule Option provides users with a Calendar, allowing them to select a day to view events for that given day and create an event if they wish using a form. The event data is then sent to a Room database held locally on the device. I was feeling a little rebellious and decided to do my own research and write it in Kotlin, compared to Java which the lecturers taught in, and the work shows. Kotlin is the new standard for Android development, so at the time it was relatively new (about 1-2 years) and risky to use for the coursework. I was one of the first to use Kotlin for the coursework assessed in the module.
